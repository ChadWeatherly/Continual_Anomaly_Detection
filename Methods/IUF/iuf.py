Algorithm Notes

Currently, we want to have one ViT class that we build on from the torchvision version.
From there, we will add methods to create the discriminator, encoder, and decoder.

    Incremental Unified Framework (IUF) for small defect inspection.

    This model integrates incremental learning into a unified reconstruction-based
    detection method without requiring feature storage in memory banks. The model uses:
    1. Object-Aware Self-Attention (OASA) to delineate semantic boundaries
    2. Semantic Compression Loss (SCL) to optimize non-primary semantic space
    3. Custom weight updating strategy to retain features of established objects
