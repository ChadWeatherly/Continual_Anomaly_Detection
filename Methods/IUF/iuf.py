    Incremental Unified Framework (IUF) for small defect inspection.

    This model integrates incremental learning into a unified reconstruction-based
    detection method without requiring feature storage in memory banks. The model uses:
    1. Object-Aware Self-Attention (OASA) to delineate semantic boundaries
    2. Semantic Compression Loss (SCL) to optimize non-primary semantic space
    3. Custom weight updating strategy to retain features of established objects
